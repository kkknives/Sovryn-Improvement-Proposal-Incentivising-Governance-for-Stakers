# Sovryn-Improvement-Proposal-Incentivising-Governance-for-Stakers
# 1. Idea
Governance is a complex process. Voting power is currently weighted by the amount of SOV an address has. This idea hopes to improve the participation rate and quality of participation for Sovryn's bitocracy. This will be done in two ways:
A. Incentivise stakers to evaluate ongoing governance proposals
B. Incentivise stakers to be transparent about their participation in governance

# 2. Motivation
Blockchain technology is at their frontiers of several fields of finance, economics, technology, and some might even argue democracy. A strong ecosystem is incentive aligned with its ecosystems' users. 
A case in point is Maker's ecosystem. Ideas are debated in the [Forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/) and they've even successfully transitioned from a Foundation to a completely Community run organisation in Jun 2021. 

Sovryn might have similar ambitions as the aspirations of the Maker community seem to be aligned to Sovryn's core vision and philosophy of decentralisation.

However, boostrapping a DAO is extremely challenging. Early DAOs had extremely low participation rates such as [The DAO Carbonvote](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/17/voting.html) which only had a 4.5% participation rate. The rest of Vitalik's articles were more concerned about potential attacks by a small number of malicious users, including some example of voter bribes etc. 2017 Vitalik states this:
>The approach for blockchain governance that I advocate is "multifactorial consensus", where different coordination flags and different mechanisms and groups are polled, and the ultimate decision depends on the collective result of all of these mechanisms together. These coordination flags may include:
>* The roadmap (ie. the set of ideas broadcasted earlier on in the project's history about the direction the project would be going)
>* Consensus among the dominant core development teams
>* Coin holder votes
>* User votes, through some kind of sybil-resistant polling system
>* Established norms (eg. non-interference with applications, the 21 million coin limit)"

Therefore, looking at the current state of Sovryn, the roadmap and consensus core development team seem to be achieved. What is left is to establish the right sort of norms so that stakers will want to actively take part or delegate their stake in order to achieve a successful governance system.

# 3. Proposal
## A. Incentivise stakers to evaluate ongoing governance proposals
**1. Kudos system**

Direct incentives for active contribution to ongoing discussions. Inspired by [Gitcoin's Kudos](https://gitcoin.co/kudos) system, the Sovryn Foundation can first set up collectible NFTs recognise for top contributors during discussions. Similarly, [reddit has trophies](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/trophies) that eventually run up a leaderboard for the best contributors to forums.

A kudos system can be implemented quite simply on-chain by building something similar to the [Proof-of-Attendance Protocol](https://poap.xyz/) where one can award NFTs for behaviour in a simple way. 

Furthermore, the Sovryn Foundation can start with curating users that perform the behaviours and norms that we would like to see in the ecosystem. Sovryn Foundation leaders can model the way for the right sort of norms and award stakers that demonstrate this behaviour.

Each kudos should be set up for a time-locked period as part of a fair dispute process. I would suggest to only give out the kudos after the governance proposal has been debated then voted on.

**2. Auditor and Facilitator roles**

Disincentives for bad behaviour inspire confidence in stakers. Stakers must see the effect of their actions in order to feel valued as part of the ecosystem. We want to prevent situations such as [Uniswap's proposal being achieved and having a large amount of the UNI token dumped](https://cointelegraph.com/news/concern-as-uniswap-backed-defi-education-fund-dumps-10m-worth-of-uni?utm_source=Telegram&utm_medium=social) right after it was approved.

Maker has set up [Facilitator roles](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip41-facilitator-framework/6098) including a complete facilitator framework and governance powers. We can build on the initial kudos awarded and nominate some of these stakers additional responsibility for governing the ecosystem.

I framed this as a disincentive because the initial auditors and facilitators will likely come from the Sovryn Foundation and it will mostly be used to penalise malicious behaviour. However, in the future, these roles can be an incentive for stakers that wish to play a larger part in the Sovryn Protocol and this can only be achieved through 'proof' of participation and making sound decisions. This is not unlike Technical Steering Committees in established software foundations.
## B. Incentivise stakers to be transparent about their participation in governance

**1. Reputation system**

Similar to the [congressional voting record](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes) system, stakers want to know that they are taking part in a fair and equitable ecosystem. That way we can look for **conflicts of interest** such as this article on [senator's trading performances](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/n940ze/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/). We want to be sure that our stakers that take part in governance have the Sovryn Protocol at heart and not for personal gain.

To do this, individual voting records should be immediately made viewable once cast. Voting records not just for the proposal in question but for all votes ever cast by that particular staker.

**2. Active reporting**

We can take a leaf from [SocialPay by Zilliqa](https://blog.zilliqa.com/support-our-twitter-campaigns-earn-zil-via-our-new-tool-socialpay-950eb67a7b1) in tracking participation of programs. SocialPay tracks tweets with a specific #hashtag and pays out rewards accordingly. Each #SIP-x could have a specific hashtag to allow for easier tracking.

If we could get delegators that have shown to be responsible to actively report their voting decisions and rationale such as Blockchain at Berkeley and some of their voting decisions for [Compound](https://twitter.com/CalBlockchain/status/1414347966349991941) and [Uniswap](https://twitter.com/CalBlockchain/status/1408560812592140294). This would further model the way for stakers and act as an inspiration to others to start getting more involved in governance. Furthermore, the arguments FOR and AGAINST governance proposals would be debated on a more open forum, attracting people that might be new to blockchain to take a peek at this brave new world.

# 4. Effect
As Vitalik mentioned, the norms are extrmeley important to encouraging participation. Charlie Munger did famously say "Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome". 

What we have created is essentially a flywheel.

# 5. Conclusion
Each proposed idea is designed to incentive active, responsible, and reasonable behaviour in governance and not just to simply participate. Each proposed idea is also not completely novel and could be implemented in a shorter amount of time. I hope Sovryn considers these proposals and look at its effects on incentivising governance.
